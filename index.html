													<p>Jonathan Rea overcame illness to win the second World Superbike race at Villicum and become the first World Superbike rider in history to win 10 successive races in a single season. Rea gritted his teeth through illness to battle his way into the lead by lap eight, and resisted a brief retaliation from Barni Racing's Xavi Fores to ease into the distance for his fifth double victory in a row. Poleman Fores grabbed the holeshot at the start from Eugene Laverty and Race 1 podium finisher Toprak Razgatlioglu, while Rea muscled his way through to fifth from eighth on the grid.</p>

													<p>Rea threw his Kawasaki up the inside of Yamaha's Michael van der Mark at Turn 12, but ran in too hot and opened the door for the Dutchman's teammate Alex Lowes to move into fourth. Another moment, as he applied the throttle while battling Ducati's Chaz Davies for fifth at Turn 7 on lap two, dropped Rea behind Marc Melandri as well, though he deposed of the Italian a few corners later. Fores continued to lead, with his 1.7s lead opening up to three when the chasing Laverty crashed going through Turn 6 on the third tour. At the same time, Rea finally cleared Davies when the Ducati man ran wide at Turn 2, and then also took third from Lowes at Turn 8. Razgatlioglu fell victim to Rea on the following lap, with the world champion demolishing Fores' lead in a handful of tours to shadow the Barni rider at the start of lap eight.</p>
